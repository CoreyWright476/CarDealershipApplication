# CarDealershipApp
this is a demo springboot application that uses some basic endpoints and implements a TDD and BDD way of working

### Working Notes
- Bug spotted: when two cars are posted at the same time the exception handler does not throw an error when it should
- Look into accounting for upper and lower cases in post data
- Consolidate method calls in car service
